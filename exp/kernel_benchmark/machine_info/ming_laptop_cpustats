analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency: 0.97 ms.
  hardware limits: 800 MHz - 3.60 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance, powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 3.50 GHz and 3.55 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 2.60 GHz.
