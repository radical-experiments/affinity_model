GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, VERSION 5.0
Executable:   /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/gromacs/5.0.0/bin/gmx
Library dir:  /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/gromacs/5.0.0/share/gromacs/top
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -ntomp 1 -nt 1 -s out.tpr -c out.gro

Reading file out.tpr, VERSION 5.0 (single precision)
The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1 (and the command-line setting agreed with that)
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 1 OpenMP thread 
Compiled SIMD instructions: SSE4.1 (Gromacs could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better)

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=OFF CMake option.
