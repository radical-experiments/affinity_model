NOTE 1 [file grompp_10000.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.25
